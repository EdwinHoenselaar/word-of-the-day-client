# word of the day

The client side of the word of the day app. For this app I use Vue.js with Vue-router.
<br>
File structure:
index.html                      Root html file
src =
    App.vue                     Root file
    components =
        NewWord.vue             Input form for entering a new word
        Word.vue                Displays the word of today
        
For http requests I use axios, currently it only runs locally, its not deployed.
