# word of the day

The client side of the word of the day app. For this app I use Vue.js with Vue-router.
<br>
File structure:<br>
index.html                      Root html file<br>
src =<br>
    App.vue                     Root file<br>
    components =<br>
        NewWord.vue             Input form for entering a new word<br>
        Word.vue                Displays the word of today<br>
        
For http requests I use axios, currently it only runs locally, its not deployed.<br>
